# PySH
<i>(Partly Your Shared Hallucination) A Python MU* Framework.</i>

<h2>What is PySH?</h2>
An *extremely* WIP Python MU* Framework. Development began February of 2015, and it's still in a pre-alpha state.
The eventual goal of the project is to be a versatile, easily extensible, data-driven MUD/MUSH/MU* framework.
